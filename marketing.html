                    Content creation and digital strategy are artforms with practical applications. Content captures, enthralls and entertains. With the right strategy, it can bring a company forward, even change the world.
                </p>
        
                <blockquote>
                    <b>Content creation and digital strategy are artforms with practical applications.</b>
                </blockquote>
        
                <p>
                    On a more practical note – <em>it generates profit.</em>
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    These two processes go hand-in-hand to drive online business. What’s more, the line between “offline” and “online” is fast becoming blurred. Digital strategy becomes content strategy and is increasing in relevance to everyday business.

               Digital marketing is an exciting and varied field. The following are some of the biggest projects I've worked on in the last couple of years. From SEO (Content & Technical) to Paid Media Strategy, take a look!

                            Online dating is a highly competitive niche and most online dating sites fail to deliver what they promise. <b>LeadingDatingSites.co.uk</b>, <b>DatingSitesReviews.com.au</b> and <b>DatingSitesReviewed.com</b> are top online dating site review portals in the UK, Australia and United States respectively. Through carefully researched and optimized expert reviews, they receive high levels of organic traffic which generate revenue via affiliate deals with top players in the online dating industry.

                            Digital nomadism is the fastest-growing lifestyle on the planet. Rapid developments in telecommunication technologies have also given risen to the phenomenon of remote working.
