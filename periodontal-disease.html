               <h1 align="center">The 4 Stages of Periodontal Disease</h1>
                
                <p>Periodontal disease affects what are known as the periodontal tissues. It can affect one or more of these tissues. These include the alveolar bone, periodontal ligament, cementum and the gingiva. All four are supporting structures that surround the tooth. If you feel you may be suffering from periodontal disease, then you should understand its four stages and how it may affect your dental health. It will help you to catch the problem early on.</p>
                   
                <p>The initial stage of periodontal disease is called gingivitis. It affects the gingiva or the gum that surrounds the tooth. Normally your gums are firm and have a pinkish color. When the initial lesion occurs, the gingiva becomes inflamed. It then starts bleeding. Bleeding gums are therefore one of the very first signs of periodontal disease.</p>
                   
                <h2>Early Periodontitis (Early Lesion)</h2>
                   
                <p>
                   With early periodontitis, the periodontal ligaments become inflamed. There is usually a minor loss of tooth attachment as well. The tooth doesn’t, however, become mobile at this stage. Patients will not normally experience loss of connective tissue either. Regardless, this first stage of periodontal disease must be monitored carefully.
                </p>
                   
                <h2>Moderate Periodontitis (Established Lesion)</h2>
                   
                <p>During this stage, patients experience a slight loss of tooth attachment to the deep pocket formation. It’s normally then that most people start to get a little worried, especially if they don’t know what periodontitis is. With an established lesion, patients are likely to lose bone support and will experience slight mobility of the tooth. The bone loss that they experience is normally between thirty and fifty percent, although it varies.</p>
                   
                <h2>Advanced Periodontitis (Advanced Lesion)</h2>
                   
                <p>At the advanced stage, periodontitis involves the breakdown of connective tissues that surround the tooth itself. Other symptoms also develop, such as severe gingival recession and the loss of tooth attachment. Bone support also decreases significantly at this stage.</p>
                   
                <p>Gingivitis is an extremely common form of periodontal disease. Interestingly, it is often found in people who are completely unaware that they have it. Gingivitis itself is considered to be non-destructive, however it can end up progressing to full periodontal disease. Those who are worried about its development should see their dentist as soon as possible.</p>
