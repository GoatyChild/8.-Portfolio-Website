                <h2><em>Samantha Fox – History</em></h2>
                
               <p>
                    Oregon native Samantha Fox founded Brightline Media in 2010. A student of Beloit College, Samantha graduated with a B.A. in Communications and Marketing in 2008. As luck would have it, that was when the United States experience the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Many new graduates faced the prospect of unemployment. Fresh-faced and unfazed, Samantha refused to accept this fate. She picked herself up and devised a new plan.

                <p>
                    Even with the economy in tatters, Samantha knew the digital world was changing things. New technologies and processes were emerging – developing at lightning speed. Seemingly overnight, many businesses were well behind the times.

                <p>
                    For Samantha, this was empowering. These new technologies promised fresh opportunities. She began her long campaign of approaching companies, pitching her services and offering to streamline their marketing efforts. Her goal: to establish long-term, sustainable awareness of their brand, whilst reducing unnecessary costs.
