               <h1 align="center">Cindarella’s Castle: An Evaluation</h1>
                
                <p>In Disney movies, Cinderalla’s castle looks like the perfect place for any princess to live with her Prince Charming. Like any piece of real estate, however, the prince and princess must be able to afford such a fine property. As a result, evaluating the modern value of Cinderella’s castle will involve taking a number of different factors into consideration. As well as the size and location, you must also take into account the renovations that will continually need to be done. In Cinderella’s kingdom, of course, magic is a commonly used force and there are also sentient animals who seem more than happy to help their human friends.</p>
                   
                <p>Before you decide to go out and view Cinderella’s castle, take a quick look at this evaluation of it and see if it would be feasible to buy. Below is a quick evaluation of how much the castle would be according to its age, its size and its location.
                </p>
                   
                <h2>Location and How It Affects Prices</h2>
                   
                <p>Cinderella’s castle is located in a magical kingdom surrounded by a deep, beautiful forest. Forests like these are comparable to those found in Bavaria, Germany. Cinderella is originally a European fairytale and therefore the architecture of the castle is going to resemble that of Medieval and Early Modern Germany. Since the castle is located in a peaceful forest with a nearby village, it is also considered to be a prime location. Residents of the castle can go down into the village for the markets, but enjoy the peace and tranquility of the surrounding forest.</p>
                   
                <p>While the price of the castle is likely to be high due to its location, there are also a few risks and threats that are posed to the castle. Since magic is a powerful force in this kingdom, there is always the constant threat of evil wizards, angry fairy godmothers and wicked witches who may want to take the castle for themselves. Threats such as these are bound to bring the property value down, unless the inhabitants of the castle use magic themselves to defend against malicious supernatural threats.</p>
                   
                <p>When calculating the price of Cinderella’s castle, it is important to consider all of these factors. In fact, the overwhelming threat of supernatural forces suggests that the property value may be brought down considerably in spite of the castle’s prime location.</p>
                   
                <h2>Evaluation of Cinderella’s Castle: Size</h2>
                   
                <p>The size of the castle can easily be gauged from the size of other castles in the area. Since Cinderella’s kingdom is likely to be located in Germany, her castle is going to share a number of characteristics with the likes of Eltz Castle in Koblenz, Rhineland-Palatine. Indeed, the castle appears most similar to this particular structure. Eltz Castle contains around one hundred different rooms and therefore Cinderella’s castle is likely to have a similar number. These will include the kitchens, the ball room and the many other state rooms that are used for political meetings. Cinderella’s castle also contains six main turrets. These turrets, according to measurements from Eltz Castle, are likely to be between thirty and forty metric meters in height.</p>
                   
                <h2>Comparable Castles</h2>
                   
                <p>There are many other castles to be found in other places outside the kingdom. Since Cinderella’s castle appears to be the only major one in the land, it brings up the property value once more. It is seen as something unique to live in will therefore ask a high price in spite of the potential risks. Some comparable buildings include Hohenschwangau Castle and of course Eltz Castle. Since these properties are located a considerable distance away from Cinderella’s castle, there is an even higher chance that it’ll be seen as valuabl. After all, it is the political center of the kingdom and therefore receives a lot of visits from diplomats, mercenaries and minor lords from around the kingdom. Minor lords are of course going to have their own castles and palaces to live in, but these properties won’t be as large as Cinderella’s castle.</p>
                   
                <h2>Evaluating the Castle</h2>
                   
                <p>Once you have taken all of these factors into account, you can easily sum up the value of Cinderella’s castle. Since it is in Europe, the property is more than likely going to be calculated using the metric system. In Rhineland-Palatine, the general price per square meter is $4, 330. Some of this price may be knocked off simply because of the constant threats of wicked witches and evil wizards who want to take the throne for themselves.</p>

Some of this price may be knocked off simply because of the constant threats of wicked witches and evil wizards who want to take the throne for themselves.</p>
                   
                <p>The castle has six turrets. Each turret will be thirty to forty meters in height. On average, each floor will have five square meters. That means five meters multiplied by thirteen floors (on average) will make about sixty-six square meters. Multiply sixty-six square meters by six and you’ve got four hundred square meters. This makes the cost of the turrets alone $1, 73, 2000.</p>
                   
                <h2>Haggling</h2>
                   
                <p>Haggling the price down for this castle can be difficult. The supernatural threats are probably the largest concern here. Its prime location, however, is going to keep the price very high. Even if you did manage to knock a couple of thousand off the price, you will still need to invest in magical defenses. Apprentice wizards aren’t going to cut it here: you’ll need full-blown experts who will be able to defend the castle if a wicked witch decides that she wants to sit on the throne.</p>
