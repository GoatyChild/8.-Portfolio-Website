                <h2>Take a Step Back in Time</h2>
                
                <p>Founded in 1967, the Museum of South Texas aims to preserve the past and give visitors an authentic historical experience. Located in Hidalgo County, the Museum offers a range of unique artifacts from Texan history. From the Rio Grande Valley to Northeastern Mexico, you will experience a whole new world of ancient culture. These fascinating exhibits are on offer for everyone who wants to learn more.</p>
                
                <h2>Experience the Past Through Exhibitions</h2>
                
                <p>Stepping into the Grand Lobby of the Museum, you will have first-hand experience of old Spanish colonial architecture. This revival architecture was popular at the start of the twentieth century and still echoes an elegant, bygone beauty.</p>
                
                <p>The main exhibition is the Rio Grande Legacy which can be found upstairs. Through the use of multimedia, the story of the region is told in an effective manner. Fossils, treasure and ancient tools are just some of the great artifacts that you will encounter here.</p>
                
                <p>At the end of the exhibition you will see the River Crossroads. A replica train station has been constructed here. Early twentieth century wars, the boom and the mass town-building is all documented here.</p>
