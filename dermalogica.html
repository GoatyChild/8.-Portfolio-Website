                <p>It is important to take care of your body as the general, everyday stresses of life can pile up and take a huge toll on your health – and your skin. This is why Dermalogica offers a range of products that will help to bring you to a higher level of health and well-being. The Body Therapy brand is specially designed to take care of the usual aches and pains that you may feel. Your skin in particular may require smoothing and relaxation to ensure that you don’t suffer from premature aging. Exfoliation is also essential as it will help to replenish the old cells. With Dermalogica, your skin will profit from a range of benefits that our products offer.</p>
                   
                <h2>Dermalogica Products</h2>
                   
                   <p>The <u>Conditioning Body Wash</u> is a body wash that is designed for the entire body. It is essentially a physical cleanser that will help to make you feel refreshed and renewed. You can simply put a little bit of it onto your hands. From there, lather it over your body and feel it cleanse. You can use this in both the bath and the shower.</p>
                   
                   <p>There is also an <u>Exfoliating Body Scrub</u>. This scrub does exactly what it says: exfoliation. It has a creamy consistency that helps to smooth and polish your skin. If you happen to have something of a “bad skin day” then this is going to be the perfect tonic. You will be able to feel the effects of this product immediately. Essential oils have been added to it to ensure that you are properly revitalized. If you are a user of a medically-prescribed exfoliation products then it is probably not a good idea to use this. If you are in doubt then you will need to speak to your doctor.</p>
                   
                <h2>Proper Body Care</h2>
                   
                   <p>Many of the Dermalogica Products are colorless and do not contain any fragrances. This means that if you are sensitive to certain smells then you won’t have to worry about irritation. These products will also have a positive effect on your mental well-being. You can relax, unwind and enjoy the soothing effect that they have on your skin. It can help to boost your mental health and therefore contribute to your overall physical health.</p>
                   
                   <p>For those who have particularly sensitive skin, Urban Detox can do a lot of wonders. This particular serum will help to replenish your skin after it has come into contact with pollutants. All you need to do is add a thin layer to the neck and the face. Moisturizer can then follow or, if you are going out, sunscreen. Urban Detox is particularly recommended for those who suffer from dry skin as it helps to ease it.</p>
