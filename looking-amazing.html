                <p><b>An amazing body – is it hard to come by? You have to admit, some people can induce a stunning transformation when it comes to weight loss. It’s often a transformation most of us only dream of – despite dieting and spending hours at the gym.</b></p>
                
                <p>Who does the <em>real</em> heavy lifting in weight loss? We often think that we should spend countless grueling hours at the gym. Yet what few of us think is that it’s our nutrition which does most of the work.</p>
                
                <p>Yes, it’s <b>what you eat</b> that has a greater impact on how you physical appearance. Does this mean we should eat bland, tasteless foods and stick to a strict diet? Not necessarily: as Dr. Phillip Goglia suggests, you should eat foods <b>that regulate your metabolism</b>. It means you can still eat what you like – <em>and shed weight!</em></p>

                <blockquote align="center" style="color:orangered;"><b>I was that fat girl who was always dieting and went to the gym. But this has been the only thing that’s worked, probably because its not a diet. It has been so much easier being able to eat the things I enjoy and also make it work for me to lose weight.</b></blockquote>

                <p>How do some celebrities maintain their gorgeous figures? It’s not a mystery. Many have expert nutritionists like Dr. Goglia advising them on the correct nutrition for them. He helps them pick out the right foods. <em>Foods that help them lose weight based on their body type</em>. And how much does this advice cost? Easily a <b>couple thousand dollars</b>.</p>
                
                <p>Don’t let that discourage you. Thanks to its success, Dr. Goglia is offering his valuable advice for little more than $39.00. After paying less than the cost of a night out, you get the following:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>A simple yet detailed quiz</b> about your body type/weight loss type. Answer the questions and provide the data.</li>
                    <li>With the gathered data, you’ll receive your own custom plan. This plan contains information regarding the type of food you need to eat from one week to the next.</li>
                    <li>It’s a fully custom plan as well: whether you’re a vegan, allergic to certain things or have other issues, all of this is taken into account.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>And the whole process costs $39.00 in comparison to the $1000s that Hollywood celebrities pay.
