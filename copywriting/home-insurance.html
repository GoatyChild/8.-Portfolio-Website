               <p>
                   In the UK, <b>health insurance</b> (also called <b>private medical insurance</b>) is optional. It covers the cost of private healthcare. While the NHS provides this for free, waiting lists for procedures can sometimes be very long. Private cover ensures that you are seen to quicker and can get treatment at private hospitals.

               <p>
                    For basic check-ups and concerns, the NHS can be great. However, if you develop a serious condition you could end up waiting for a long time to get treatment. Medical treatment can indeed be costly and the amount covered will depend on the type of health insurance you pay.

               <h2>The Main Benefits of Health Insurance</h2>
                
               <p>
                    For UK residents, private health insurance affords a number of benefits that you simply won’t get on the public system. You can, for example, choose your preferred hospital and consultant. Private patients will also get a room to themselves. Another benefit is that the level of cover can be chosen to suit the specific needs of the individual and the family – as well as budget.
