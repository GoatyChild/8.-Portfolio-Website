                <p>
                    Hey guys, it’s Timmy Thermal here. Let’s kick off today’s post with a rather dry but useful topic… Managed print services!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Managed print services do pretty much what they say on the tin: they manage your printing! It may not surprise you as a business owner to know that printing can cost a lot of money (think about it: ink, paper… that stuff ain’t cheap!). You also need to consider the kind of printer you need. AND you want to figure out how much you want to splurge on a device! The great thing is that these services are usually externally outsourced so you don’t have to worry your head about it too much.
                </p>
                
                <h2>MPS – Does Everyone Really Need It?</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Well… This is a bit of pickle. Big companies will probably hugely benefit from it. After all, they’ve usually got so many departments running all kinds of things that they sometimes just need a break. Handing over the planning and implementation of something as simple as basic as printing can surprisingly take a huge load off.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But what about the small guy? The startup, the small business that has been slugging away for the last ten years?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I guess it really depends on your needs and how much paper you use. If you’re an online marketing company, you probably don’t need that much paper. If you’re a small company but have a lot of paper work and documents to file (think a doctor’s office), considering managed print services is probably a good idea!
                </p>
                
                <h2>Managed Print Services: Get a Need Assessment!</h2>
                
                <p>
                    If something like printing is driving you and your employees up the wall, a needs assessment is a great idea! You should basically check out how much paper you use, how much ink and what documents are <em>really</em> important – so important that they need hard copies! You may scoff at it, but taking the time to figure it out could really be enlightening. I mean, even if you make a few small savings with a minimal amount of effort, you’re in the running to win!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So, the main thing to take away here is that it really depends on needs. I guess I wouldn’t say <em>absolutely</em> everyone needs managed print services… But for most businesses, you’ll probably want to seriously consider it – if you want to save money and boost your efficiency! Plus, you’ve got the added benefit of having hard copies and better information security. Who doesn’t want that?
